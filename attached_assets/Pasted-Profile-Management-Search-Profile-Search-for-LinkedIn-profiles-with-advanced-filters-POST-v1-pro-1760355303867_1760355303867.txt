Notes

Company and school identifiers can be either:
Full LinkedIn URLs (https://www.linkedin.com/company/…)
Company/school names or identifiers
Location search supports:
Cities
Regions
Countries
Market areas
Profile pictures are direct links to LinkedIn’s media servers
Missing information is marked as ‘N/A’
Profile pictures may be null if not available or restricted
The total_available_results field shows the total number of profiles that match your search criteria on LinkedIn
Results are paginated with a maximum of 50 profiles per page
Pagination Mode vs. Total Results Mode:
Total Results Mode: Use the total_results parameter to specify how many profiles you want (default)
Pagination Mode: Use start_page and end_page parameters to fetch specific pages of results
Credit usage in pagination mode is based on the number of pages fetched (1 credit per page)
When using pagination mode, total_results parameter is ignored
Invitation State Feature:
When fetch_invitation_state is enabled (default), the API makes additional requests to determine the current invitation/connection status
This feature helps you understand whether you can send connection requests to specific profiles
Setting fetch_invitation_state to false will improve response time but won’t include invitation status information
Invitation states are determined in real-time and reflect the current LinkedIn relationship status
Search results may be limited by:
LinkedIn’s visibility settings
Your network connection level
Profile privacy settings
