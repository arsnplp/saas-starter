Notes

The API supports two post URL formats:
Feed updates: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:...
share url: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/..
Results are paginated with a maximum of 50 comments per page
The profile picture URL may be null if not available or if the user has no profile picture
Connection degree shows your network relationship with the commenter (1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree connection)
Pagination Mode vs. Total Results Mode:
Total Results Mode: Use the total_results parameter to specify how many comments you want (default)
Pagination Mode: Use start_page and end_page parameters to fetch specific pages of results
Credit usage in pagination mode is based on the number of pages fetched (1 credit per page)
When using pagination mode, total_results parameter is ignored
The total_available_results field shows the total number of comments available on the post
Some comment information may be limited based on:
Your connection level with the commenter
The commenter’s privacy settings
The post’s visibility settings
Rate limits apply to comment retrieval requests
