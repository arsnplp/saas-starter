# Next.js SaaS Starter

## Overview

This is a full-stack SaaS starter template built with Next.js 15, featuring subscription management, team collaboration, and lead generation capabilities. The application provides a complete foundation for building modern SaaS products with authentication, payment processing, and multi-tenancy support.

The system is designed as a B2B SaaS platform with:
- Marketing website with pricing pages
- User authentication and session management
- Team-based multi-tenancy with role-based access control
- Stripe subscription management
- Lead generation and tracking system
- Activity logging for audit trails
- LinkedIn integration for social engagement tracking

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and React Server Components
- Uses experimental features: PPR (Partial Prerendering), client segment cache, and node middleware
- Server-first rendering with selective client components ("use client" directives)
- SWR for client-side data fetching with fallback data from server
- Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- TailwindCSS 4.x for styling with custom theme variables

**Routing Structure**:
- Public routes: `/` (landing), `/pricing`
- Authentication routes: `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`
- Protected dashboard routes: `/dashboard/*` with nested settings pages
- Additional features: `/leads`, `/icp`, `/engagement/post`, `/entreprises`

**State Management**:
- Server state via React Server Components and Server Actions
- Client state using SWR for data fetching with optimistic updates
- Form state managed through `useActionState` hook
- Session state stored in HTTP-only cookies

### Backend Architecture

**API Layer**:
- Next.js API routes for data endpoints (`/api/user`, `/api/team`)
- Server Actions for mutations (create, update, delete operations)
- Stripe webhook handlers for subscription events
- Custom middleware for authentication and route protection

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- JWT-based session management using `jose` library
- Tokens stored in HTTP-only, secure, SameSite cookies
- bcrypt for password hashing (10 salt rounds)
- Role-based access control (Owner/Member roles)
- Global middleware protects `/dashboard` routes
- Session refresh on GET requests (24-hour expiration)

**Multi-Tenant Security Patterns** (Oct 2025):
- **Critical Rule**: All Server Actions MUST derive team context from authenticated session
- **Pattern for all mutations**:
  1. Call `getUser()` to validate authentication
  2. Call `getTeamForUser()` to get session-derived team
  3. Validate resource ownership with `eq(table.teamId, team.id)` constraints
  4. Never trust client-submitted teamId or resource IDs without verification
- **Applied to**: Target companies (generateCompaniesAction, updateCompanyStatusAction), ICP profiles, leads, prospects
- **Prevents**: Cross-team data tampering, unauthorized resource access, multi-tenant isolation violations

**Database Layer**:
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- Connection pooling via `pg` library with 5-second timeout
- Schema includes: users, teams, team_members, activity_logs, invitations, prospect_candidates, leads, messages, icp_profiles

**Key Tables**:
- `users`: Authentication and profile data with soft deletes
- `teams`: Multi-tenant organization units with Stripe metadata
- `team_members`: Junction table for user-team relationships with roles
- `prospect_candidates`: **Staging table** for LinkedIn engagements (reactions/comments) before manual validation
- `leads`: **Qualified contacts** after manual validation and conversion from prospects
- `target_companies`: **Target company list** generated by GPT based on ICP for manual prospecting
  - Fields: name, industry, reason, linkedin_url, website, status (not_contacted/contacted/in_progress/closed), notes
  - Links to ICP profile used for generation
- `messages`: Outbound communications sent to leads (LinkedIn DMs, emails)
- `activity_logs`: Audit trail for user actions
- `icp_profiles`: Ideal Customer Profile definitions for lead discovery
  - Required fields: industries, locations, buyer_roles, keywords_include/exclude, company_size_min/max, min_score
  - **Optional context fields** (added Oct 2025): `problem_statement` (TEXT - description du produit/entreprise), `ideal_customer_example` (TEXT)
  - Context fields enhance AI scoring with product description and perfect customer example for calibration

**Lead Generation Workflow** (AI-Powered):

**Mode 1-3 (Chaud/Espion/Magnet)**: LinkedIn post engagement → `prospect_candidates` (staging)

**Mode 4 (Lead Froid)** - **INTELLIGENT Company Targeting with Precision Filtering (Oct 2025)**:
1. **GPT generates 10-15 target companies** with advanced qualification logic:
   - **Client Final Detection**: GPT explicitly distinguishes end-user clients from partners/integrators/resellers
   - Uses `problem_statement` to understand WHO actually has the problem the product solves
   - Uses `ideal_customer_example` to calibrate targeting (reference model for perfect match)
   - **Exclusion Logic**: Automatically filters out SSII/ESN, consultants, digital agencies, software competitors
   - **Industry-Specific Intelligence**: Provides concrete examples (e.g., "energy management" → hotels, hospitals, property managers, NOT tech agencies)
   - **5-Step Validation Method**: 
     1. Analyze the problem → identify who really has it
     2. Identify decision-maker → who signs the check
     3. Think daily usage → who opens the app every day
     4. Verify alignment → matches ideal customer example
     5. Double-check → "Will they USE or RESELL?" → exclude if resell
   - **NEW**: GPT also provides LinkedIn company URL (format: `Klepierre|linkedin.com/company/klepierre`)
   - Avoids previously suggested companies (stored in `icp_profiles.suggestedCompanies` JSONB field)
   - Temperature 0.8 for creative variation each search
   - **JSON Structured Response** (Oct 2025): GPT returns structured JSON for reliable parsing
     - Primary: JSON format with `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` enforcement
     - Format: `{"companies": [{"name": "...", "linkedin_url": "..."}]}`
     - Fallback: Text parsing with prefix stripping if JSON fails (backward compatibility)
     - Benefits: Eliminates all bullet/formatting issues, preserves numeric company names automatically
2. **Search profiles with precision filtering**: For each company, search LinkUp using company_url parameter
   - **Primary method** (when LinkedIn URL available): Uses `title` + `company_url` parameters
     - Example: `title: "CTO"` + `company_url: "linkedin.com/company/klepierre"`
     - **Guarantees 100% accuracy**: Only returns profiles working AT that company
   - **Fallback method** (if URL unavailable): Uses `keyword` parameter like before
     - Example: `keyword: "CTO Klepierre"`
     - Less precise but still functional
   - Max 5 profiles per company
   - Filters invalid URLs (search results pages, headless, "Utilisateur LinkedIn")
3. **Cost-optimized batching**: Stops at 10 qualified profiles OR 50 total profiles (5 credits max)
4. **Quality guarantee**: With company_url filtering, 10 imported profiles = 10 profiles from correct company + correct job title ✅

**AI Scoring Pipeline** (Modes 1-3):
- Click "Scorer" button triggers profile enrichment via LinkUp API (`/v1/profile/info`)
- Enriched profile includes: name, headline, location, industry, experience (with company_size), education, skills
- OpenAI GPT-4o analyzes profile against ICP criteria using **adaptive weighting system**:
  - **Fit Métier** (0-30pts): Decision-making power and role alignment
  - **Fit Entreprise** (0-25pts): Company size (strict), industry, context
  - **Fit Problème** (0-25pts): Signals of business problem we solve (uses `problem_statement` if provided)
  - **Signaux Exclusion** (-50pts penalty): Presence of exclusion keywords
  - **Localisation** (0-10pts): Geographic alignment
  - **Signaux d'Achat Bonus** (0-10pts): Recent job change, company growth indicators
- Uses `ideal_customer_example` for score calibration when provided (90-100 = near-perfect match)
- Returns JSON: `{ score: 0-100, reasoning: "detailed breakdown + recommendation" }` in French
- Stores `ai_score`, `ai_reasoning`, `enriched_profile` in `prospect_candidates`

**Auto-Promotion Logic**:
- If score ≥ `icp_profiles.minScore` → automatically converts to `leads` table
- If score < minScore → remains in prospects with status 'analyzed'

**Outreach**: Messages stored in `messages` table

**Target Companies Feature** - **GPT-Powered Company Discovery (Oct 2025)**:
- **Simplified Alternative** to automated profile search via LinkUp
- **Use Case**: When user needs a list of relevant companies to contact manually (without automated LinkedIn profile import)
- **Workflow**:
  1. User selects an ICP profile
  2. Specifies number of companies to generate (5-30)
  3. GPT-4o generates target companies based on ICP criteria
  4. Companies stored in `target_companies` table with: name, industry, reason, LinkedIn URL, status
  5. User manually tracks contact status (not_contacted → contacted → in_progress → closed)
- **GPT Prompt Strategy**:
  - Uses ICP fields: industries, locations, problem_statement, ideal_customer_example
  - Focuses on end-user companies (not resellers/integrators)
  - Provides industry context and relevance reasoning for each company
  - Returns JSON structured response with company details and LinkedIn URLs
  - Temperature 0.8 for variety across multiple generations
- **Status Tracking**: Simple manual workflow to mark companies as contacted/in-progress/closed
- **No LinkUp Credits Used**: Pure GPT generation, no profile enrichment or search
- **Page**: `/dashboard/entreprises` with filterable list and generate button
- **Security**: Multi-tenant isolation enforced via session-derived team scoping (see Security Patterns below)

**Cost Optimization Strategy**:
- LinkUp API charged 1 credit per profile enrichment
- Enrichment only happens once per prospect (cached in `enriched_profile` JSONB field)
- Subsequent scoring reuses cached data to avoid redundant API calls

**Business Logic Patterns**:
- Server Actions with Zod schema validation
- Middleware wrappers for authentication (`validatedActionWithUser`, `withTeam`)
- Activity logging for compliance and audit trails
- Optimistic UI updates with server-side revalidation
